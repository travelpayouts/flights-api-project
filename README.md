## Installation

Download and unzip package or clone it to your web folder `git clone https://github.com/travelpayouts/flights-api-project.git`

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install dependencies.

### Installing Composer

If you do not already have Composer installed, you may do so by following the instructions at getcomposer.org. On Linux and Mac OS X, you'll run the following commands

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
On Windows, you'll download and run [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe).

### Installing Composer packages
Just use command `composer install`.

### Changing your app parameters
Before first running of your app, you need to set app params. All your params is located in **config/params.php**

```php
<?php

return [
    // set target language
    'language' => 'en-US',
    // set source language
    'sourceLanguage' => 'en-US',
    'params' => [
        'apiToken' => 'e451ad62a0e8468732b6e1ada1e58223', // Token https://www.travelpayouts.com/programs/100/tools/api
        'apiMarker' => '132474', // Marker https://www.travelpayouts.com/programs/100/tools/api
        'apiResponseLang' => 'en', // Response language : en,ru,de,es,fr,it,pl,th.
        'title' => 'TravelPayouts sample app', // Title of your app
        'baseUrl' => '/flights-api-project', // Path of your app (for example: if your project url is http//site.com/flight set 'baseUrl'=> '/flights', if it in root directory set 'baseUrl'=> ''
    ],
];

```

### Setting webserver
* [Apache HTTP server](http://httpd.apache.org/) users have all needed .htaccess files out of box.
* [Nginx HTTP server](http://nginx.org/) users should install PHP as an [FPM SAPI](http://php.net/install.fpm). You may use the following Nginx configuration, replacing `path/to/basic/web` with the actual path for `basic/web` and `mysite.local` with the actual hostname to serve.

```nginx
server {
    charset utf-8;
    client_max_body_size 128M;

    listen 80; ## listen for ipv4
    #listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on; ## listen for ipv6

    server_name mysite.local;
    root        /path/to/basic/web;
    index       index.php;

    access_log  /path/to/basic/log/access.log;
    error_log   /path/to/basic/log/error.log;

    location / {
        # Redirect everything that isn't a real file to index.php
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    # uncomment to avoid processing of calls to non-existing static files by Yii
    #location ~ \.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar)$ {
    #    try_files $uri =404;
    #}
    #error_page 404 /404.html;

    # deny accessing php files for the /assets directory
    location ~ ^/assets/.*\.php$ {
        deny all;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        #fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location ~* /\. {
        deny all;
    }
}
```
